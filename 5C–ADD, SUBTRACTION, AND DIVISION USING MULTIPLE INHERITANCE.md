# Experiment No: 5câ€“Add, Subtraction, and Division Using Multiple Inheritance

## AIM  
To create a Python program that calculates the addition, subtraction, and division using multiple inheritance.

---

## ALGORITHM  
1. Define class `c1` with a method `add(self, a, b)` to return the sum of `a` and `b`.
2. Define class `c2` with a method `sub(self, a, b)` to return the difference between `a` and `b`.
3. Define class `divi` that inherits from both `c1` and `c2`, and add a method `div(self, a, b)` to return the division result of `a` and `b`.
4. Take user input for `a` and `b`.
5. Instantiate the class `divi`.
6. Call the `add()`, `sub()`, and `div()` methods to perform the respective operations.
7. Display the results.
8. Terminate the program.

## ðŸ§¾ PROGRAM

```python
class c1:  
    def add(self, a, b):  
        return a + b  

class c2:  
    def sub(self, a, b):  
        return a - b  

class divi(c1, c2):
    def div(self, a, b):  
        return float(a / b)  

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
d = divi()  
print(d.add(a, b))  
print(d.sub(a, b))  
print(d.div(a, b))

```
